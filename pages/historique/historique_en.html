        <p>The french society of Radiotéléphone, <span>SFR</span>, is a French telecommunications operator branch bringing together the telecoms activities of Altice de France.
            This company was created by the General Water Company in <b>1987</b>. <br> <br>Owned entirely by Vivendi since <b>2011</b>, it was bought by ALTICE in 2014, to form the <span>Numericable_SFR</span> group. In <b>2016</b> <span>SFR GROUP</span>a Telecom, Media and Advertising group is born. The Numericable brand is only used by the group for its bouquet of television channels.
            <br><br>In May <b>2017</b>, the <span>Altice</span> group announced its intention to consolidate most of its activities under its name. As part of this merger, SFR will be renamed <span>Altice6</span> Thus, on , the SFR mobile network takes the name <span>SFR Altice</span> in order to accustom customers to the name planned to be adopted by SFR: <span>Altice7.</span> <br> The idea was finally abandoned in March <b>2018</b>. following the setbacks (decline in share price and financial results) of SFR in <b>2017</b>. Altice wishes to maintain a brand with a very strong reputation with the aim of improving its results for the months and years to come.
